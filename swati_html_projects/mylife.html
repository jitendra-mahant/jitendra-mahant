        <hr>The Kidney Disease
    </h2>







    <p> Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. Your
        kidneys
        filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. Advanced chronic kidney
        disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.

        In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms. You might not realize that
        you
        have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.<br>
        Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling
        the
        cause. But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing. Chronic kidney disease can
        progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney
        transplant</p><br>

    <h2> Rick Factor</h2>
    <hr>
    Factors that can increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include:

    Diabetes
    High blood pressure
    Heart (cardiovascular) disease
    Smoking
    Obesity
    Being Black, Native American or Asian American
    Family history of kidney disease
    Abnormal kidney structure
    Older age
    Frequent use of medications that can damage the kidneys<br>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease:

    Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin,
    ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), follow the instructions on the package.
    Taking too many pain relievers for a long time could lead to kidney damage.
    Maintain a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, maintain it by being physically active most days of the
    week. If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss.
    Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker,
    talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to
    stop.
    Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help. If you have diseases or conditions that increase your risk
    of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney
    damage.
